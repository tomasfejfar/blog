Code completion is the cornerstone of effective PhpStorm use. I'll show you some of the ways to help the IDE to understand your code.   

Tools like refactoring and code inspections fully depend on how well PhpStorm can understand what's happening in your code. But because PHP is a dynamically typed language it much bigger feat the strongly-typed Java.

Like it or not, most of the PHP code in the wild dependents on arrays. Most of the codebases you get in touch with were not written in the last year to work with PHP 7.1. No, they would probably work in 5.3 that is long gone (at least officially). Most of it won't be based on <abbr title="Domain Driven Design">DDD</abbr> nor will it adhere to <abbr title="Single Responsibility Principle">SRP</abbr>. 

PhpStorm can be a valuable ally in the fight with messy code. It can help you refactor complexity and clean up the codebase. But it will be only as useful as the information you give it to work with. So let's see how can you point it in the right direction. 

## Docblocks

Docblocks are documentation comments that are not directly parsed by the language parser, but can be accessed both in your code using reflection as well as using external tools (like IDE). You can see typical docblock below. 

```php
<?php
/**
 * @param string $name
 * @param int $age
 * @param Address|null $address
 * @return User
 */
public function createUser($name, $age, $address) {
    return new User($name, $age, $address);
}
```
The block above the code it telling your IDE that the parameter `$name` is `string`, `$age` is `integer` and `$address` is an instance of `Address` or `null`. Also we let it know that the function returns an instance of `User`. While in this exact case PhpStorm would be clever enough to understand that the function returns `User` in many cases it would not have a clue.
